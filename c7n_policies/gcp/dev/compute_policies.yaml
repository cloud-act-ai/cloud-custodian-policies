  # Find VMs without required tags (env and owner)
  - name: gcp-vm-missing-required-labels
    resource: gcp.instance
    description: |
      Identifies Google Compute Engine instances (VMs) that are missing required labels.
      Required labels help with cost allocation, ownership tracking, and resource governance.
      This policy checks for the absence of 'env' and 'owner' labels.

      Identifies Google Compute Engine instances with low CPU utilization.
      These VMs might be oversized or unused, and are candidates for rightsizing or termination.

      Identifies Google Compute Engine instances with no network activity (ingress or egress).

      Identifies Google Compute Engine instances with moderate CPU utilization (10-50%).
      These VMs might be candidates for rightsizing to a smaller machine type.
