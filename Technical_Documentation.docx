# Cloud Custodian: Enterprise FinOps Implementation
## Technical Documentation - v1.1

## Executive Summary

### What is the tool supposed to do?
Cloud Custodian is an open-source policy engine designed to manage and govern cloud resources across multiple providers. It enables real-time compliance enforcement, cost optimization, and security governance through a simple, declarative YAML-based policy language.

### What is the installation process of the software?
Cloud Custodian is installed using Python's package manager (pip) with a simple command: `pip install c7n c7n-gcp`. It requires minimal dependencies and can be deployed as a standalone CLI tool, containerized solution, or serverless function, making deployment straightforward in any environment.

### What is the use case that the MVP is trying to solve?
Our MVP aims to solve three critical FinOps challenges:
1. Identifying and optimizing underutilized cloud resources (BigQuery and Compute Engine)
2. Enforcing resource tagging and labeling policies for cost allocation
3. Providing automated reporting on cost optimization opportunities

### What are the challenges involved in scaling this solution?
Scaling challenges include:
1. Managing policies across hundreds of projects and thousands of resources
2. Ensuring appropriate permissions and access controls
3. Handling policy notifications and approvals at scale
4. Balancing automated remediation with operational safety

### What is the effort to make this production ready?
To make this production ready, we require:
1. 8 weeks of implementation time
2. One part-time cloud engineer for implementation
3. Development of ~20 core policies for our priority use cases
4. Integration with our existing reporting and alerting infrastructure

### Can you describe the end to end solution in detail?
Our end-to-end solution consists of:
1. Policy definition stored in Git with CI/CD integration
2. Scheduled execution through Airflow for regular enforcement
3. Manual CLI triggers for on-demand policy runs
4. GCS and BigQuery storage for results and compliance data
5. Looker/Grafana dashboards for visualization and reporting
6. Optional automated remediation for approved policy violations
7. Notification workflows for policy violations requiring manual intervention

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document presents a proof of concept for implementing Cloud Custodian as our enterprise FinOps solution. Cloud Custodian will enable automated cloud resource governance, cost optimization, and security compliance across our Google Cloud Platform infrastructure.

### 1.2 Scope

* Implement Cloud Custodian for automated cloud cost management
* Establish governance policies for BigQuery and Compute resources
* Create a reporting workflow for visibility into cost optimization opportunities
* Develop a remediation framework for addressing inefficient resource usage

## 2. Business Case

### 2.1 Current Challenges

* Manual cloud cost monitoring is time-consuming and error-prone
* Unoptimized cloud resources lead to unnecessary spending
* Lack of automated enforcement of cloud resource policies
* Limited visibility into cost optimization opportunities
* Reactive rather than proactive approach to cloud spend management

### 2.2 Expected Benefits

* Reduce cloud spend by 15-25% through automated resource optimization
* Free up engineering time by automating resource governance
* Improve compliance with organizational tagging and security policies
* Provide real-time visibility into cloud resource usage and opportunities
* Shift from reactive to proactive cloud cost management

## 3. Proof of Concept Results

Our proof of concept implementation has already identified several optimization opportunities:

* **BigQuery**: Identified unpartitioned large tables increasing query costs
* **Compute Engine**: Detected underutilized VMs with less than 20% CPU usage
* **Resource Governance**: Found resources missing required tags and labels
* **Cost Avoidance**: Identified potential savings of $X per month through right-sizing

## 4. Technical Solution

### 4.1 Cloud Custodian Architecture

Cloud Custodian operates as a policy engine that helps manage cloud resources through:

* **Policy Definition**: YAML-based policies that define resource filters and actions
* **Resource Discovery**: Scanning cloud environments to identify resources matching policy criteria
* **Policy Enforcement**: Taking specified actions on non-compliant resources
* **Reporting**: Generating detailed reports on resource compliance and actions taken

### 4.2 Key Components

* **Policies**: Defined set of rules for resource governance (BigQuery + Compute)
* **Execution**: Both scheduled (Airflow) and on-demand (CLI) policy enforcement
* **Storage**: GCS and BigQuery for results and analysis
* **Analytics**: Looker/Grafana dashboards for visualization
* **Remediation**: Automated or approval-based resource optimization

### 4.3 Implementation Approach

* **Phase 1**: Deploy Cloud Custodian with monitoring-only policies (no automatic remediation)
* **Phase 2**: Implement reporting and dashboards for cost visualization
* **Phase 3**: Enable approved automatic remediation policies with safeguards
* **Phase 4**: Expand to additional resource types and advanced use cases

## 5. Evaluation Criteria
